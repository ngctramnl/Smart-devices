## Business tasks
* The founder asks you to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. She then wants you to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation. These questions will guide the analysis:
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## Data sources
* This analysis uses public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits

## Suggestions
* There is a positive relationship between total minutes asleep and total time in bed. The company can use these trends to market the wellness watch "Time" as a way to track total minutes asleep and suggest needed time in bed so that woman can achieve their sleep needs.
* The marketing team can position the "Leaf" tracker as a way to notify woman who sleep more than their needs to be more active during the days to achieve their health and fitness goals.
